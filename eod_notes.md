## End of Day Notes

### Day2:
- Essentialy closed the loop:
	- Clustered users with kmeans and hierarchial clustering
	- Got model to predict meal rating based on the ingredients
	- Inspected ingredient (aka feature) importances
- Looking forwards:
	- Edit hierachial clustering to show top three foods for each group in graph
	- Utilize clusters in prediction:
		- Starts from sql querry where rating are split into cluster groups.
		- Refit model for each cluster groups different targets.
